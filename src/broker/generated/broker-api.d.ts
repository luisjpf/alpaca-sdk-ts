     * Subscribe to Trade Events (SSE) (Legacy)
     * @deprecated
     * @description **Deprecation notice**
     *
     *     As part of the deprecation process, the legacy trade events API is now only available for existing broker-partners at: `GET /v1/events/trades` only for compatibility reasons.
     *
     *     All new broker partners will not have the option for the legacy trade event endpoint.
     *
     *     All new broker partners will have to integrate with the new `/v2/events/trades` endpoint.
     *
     *     Also, all existing broker partners are now recommended to upgrade to the `/v2/events/trades` endpoint, which provides faster event delivery times.
     *
     *     For trade events of MLeg (multi-leg) order, please use the `/v2/events/trades` endpoint.
     *
     *     Please note that the new `/v2` endpoint, is the same as, and was originally available under `/v2beta1`.
     *     We encourage all customers to adjust their codebase from that interim beta endpoint to the `/v2` stable endpoint.
     *     In the near future we will setup permanent redirect from `/v2beta1` to `/v2` before we completely remove the beta endpoint.
     *
     *     ---
     *
     *     The Events API provides event push as well as historical queries via SSE (server sent events).
     *
     *     You can listen to events related to trade updates. Most market trades sent during market hours are filled instantly; you can listen to limit order updates through this endpoint.
     *
     *     Historical events are streamed immediately if queried, and updates are pushed as events occur.
     *
     *     Query Params Rules:

     *     **Deprecation note**
     *
     *     Legacy event id (integer based) is unavailable for new broker partners, and it will be deprecated for existing brokers as well.
     *     This deprecation is includes the `since_id` and `until_id` query parameter and the `event_id` field in the response.

     *
     *     **Common events**
     *
     *     These are the events that are the expected results of actions you may have taken by sending API requests.
     *
     *     The meaning of the timestamp field changes for each type; the meanings have been specified here for which types the timestamp field will be present.
     *
     *     - `accepted` Sent when an order recieved and accepted by Alpaca
     *     - `pending_new` Sent when the order has been received by Alpaca and routed to the exchanges, but has not yet been accepted for execution.
     *     - `new` Sent when an order has been routed to exchanges for execution.
     *     - `fill` Sent when your order has been completely filled.
     *       - timestamp: The time at which the order was filled.
     *     - `partial_fill` Sent when a number of shares less than the total remaining quantity on your order has been filled.
     *       - timestamp: The time at which the shares were filled.
     *     - `canceled` Sent when your requested cancellation of an order is processed.
     *       - timestamp: The time at which the order was canceled.
     *     - `expired` Sent when an order has reached the end of its lifespan, as determined by the order's time in force value.
     *       - timestamp: The time at which the order expired.
     *     - `done_for_day` Sent when the order is done executing for the day, and will not receive further updates until the next trading day.
     *     - `replaced` Sent when your requested replacement of an order is processed.
     *       - timestamp: The time at which the order was replaced.
     *
     *     **Rarer events**
     *
     *     These are events that may rarely be sent due to unexpected circumstances on the exchanges. It is unlikely you will need to design your code around them, but you may still wish to account for the possibility that they will occur.
     *
     *     - `rejected` Sent when your order has been rejected.
     *     - `held` For multi-leg orders, the secondary orders (stop loss, take profit) will enter this state while waiting to be triggered.
     *     - `stopped` Sent when your order has been stopped, and a trade is guaranteed for the order, usually at a stated price or better, but has not yet occurred.
     *     - `pending_cancel` Sent when the order is awaiting cancellation. Most cancellations will occur without the order entering this state.
     *     - `pending_replace` Sent when the order is awaiting replacement.
     *     - `calculated` Sent when the order has been completed for the day - it is either filled or done_for_day - but remaining settlement calculations are still pending.
     *     - `suspended` Sent when the order has been suspended and is not eligible for trading.
     *     - `order_replace_rejected` Sent when the order replace has been rejected.
     *     - `order_cancel_rejected` Sent when the order cancel has been rejected.
     *     - `trade_bust`: Sent when a previously reported execution has been canceled (“busted”) by the upstream exchange.
     *     - `trade_correct`: Sent when a previously reported trade has been corrected. For example, the exchange may have updated the price, quantity, or another execution parameter after the trade was initially reported.

     *     ###  Comment messages
     *     According to the SSE specification, any line that starts with a colon is a comment which does not contain data.  It is typically a free text that does not follow any data schema. A few examples mentioned below for comment messages.
     *
     *     #####  Slow client
     *
     *     The server sends a comment when the client is not consuming messages fast enough. Example: `: you are reading too slowly, dropped 10000 messages`
     *
     *     ##### Internal server error
     *
     *     An error message is sent as a comment when the server closes the connection on an internal server error (only sent by the v2 and v2beta1 endpoints). Example: `: internal server error`

     *     - Options trading: day.
     *     - Crypto trading: gtc, ioc.
     *
     *     Below are the descriptions of each TIF:
     *     - day:
     *       A day order is eligible for execution only on the day it is live. By default, the order is only valid during Regular Trading Hours (9:30am - 4:00pm ET). If unfilled after the closing auction, it is automatically canceled. If submitted after the close, it is queued and submitted the following trading day. However, if marked as eligible for extended hours, the order can also execute during supported extended hours.
     *
     *     - gtc:
     *       The order is good until canceled. Non-marketable GTC limit orders are subject to price adjustments to offset corporate actions affecting the issue. We do not currently support Do Not Reduce(DNR) orders to opt out of such price adjustments.
     *
     *     - opg:
     *       Use this TIF with a market/limit order type to submit “market on open” (MOO) and “limit on open” (LOO) orders. This order is eligible to execute only in the market opening auction. Any unfilled orders after the open will be cancelled. OPG orders submitted after 9:28am but before 7:00pm ET will be rejected. OPG orders submitted after 7:00pm will be queued and routed to the following day’s opening auction. On open/on close orders are routed to the primary exchange. Such orders do not necessarily execute exactly at 9:30am / 4:00pm ET but execute per the exchange’s auction rules.
     *
     *     - cls:
     *       Use this TIF with a market/limit order type to submit “market on close” (MOC) and “limit on close” (LOC) orders. This order is eligible to execute only in the market closing auction. Any unfilled orders after the close will be cancelled. CLS orders submitted after 3:50pm but before 7:00pm ET will be rejected. CLS orders submitted after 7:00pm will be queued and routed to the following day’s closing auction. Only available with API v2.
     *
     *     - ioc:
     *       An Immediate Or Cancel (IOC) order requires all or part of the order to be executed immediately. Any unfilled portion of the order is canceled. Only available with API v2. Most market makers who receive IOC orders will attempt to fill the order on a principal basis only, and cancel any unfilled balance. On occasion, this can result in the entire order being cancelled if the market maker does not have any existing inventory of the security in question.
     *
     *     - fok:
     *       A Fill or Kill (FOK) order is only executed if the entire order quantity can be filled, otherwise the order is canceled. Only available with API v2.

     * @description **Common events**
     *
     *     These are the events that are the expected results of actions you may have taken by sending API requests.
     *
     *     The meaning of the `timestamp` field changes for each type; the meanings have been specified here for which types the
     *     timestamp field will be present.
     *
     *     - `new`: Sent when an order has been routed to exchanges for execution.
     *     - `fill`: Sent when your order has been completely filled.
     *       - `timestamp`: The time at which the order was filled.
     *     - `partial_fill`: Sent when a number of shares less than the total remaining quantity on your order has been filled.
     *       - `timestamp`: The time at which the shares were filled.
     *     - `canceled`: Sent when your requested cancellation of an order is processed.
     *       - `timestamp`: The time at which the order was canceled.
     *     - `expired`: Sent when an order has reached the end of its lifespan, as determined by the order’s time in force value.
     *       - `timestamp`: The time at which the order expired.
     *     - `done_for_day`: Sent when the order is done executing for the day, and will not receive further updates until the next trading day.
     *     - `replaced`: Sent when your requested replacement of an order is processed.
     *       - `timestamp`: The time at which the order was replaced.
     *
     *     **Rarer events**
     *
     *     These are events that may rarely be sent due to unexpected circumstances on the exchanges. It is unlikely you will need to design your code around them, but you may still wish to account for the possibility that they will occur.
     *
     *     - `rejected`: Sent when your order has been rejected.
     *       - `timestamp`: The time at which the rejection occurred.
     *     - `pending_new`: Sent when the order has been received by Alpaca and routed to the exchanges, but has not yet been accepted for execution.
     *     - `stopped`: Sent when your order has been stopped, and a trade is guaranteed for the order, usually at a stated price or better, but has not yet occurred.
     *     - `pending_cancel`: Sent when the order is awaiting cancellation. Most cancellations will occur without the order entering this state.
     *     - `pending_replace`: Sent when the order is awaiting replacement.
     *     - `calculated`: Sent when the order has been completed for the day - it is either `filled` or `done_for_day` - but remaining settlement calculations are still pending.
     *     - `suspended`: Sent when the order has been suspended and is not eligible for trading.
     *     - `order_replace_rejected`: Sent when the order replace has been rejected.
     *     - `order_cancel_rejected`: Sent when the order cancel has been rejected.
     *     - `trade_bust`: Sent when a previously reported execution has been canceled (“busted”) by the upstream exchange.
     *     - `trade_correct`: Sent when a previously reported trade has been corrected. For example, the exchange may have updated the price, quantity, or another execution parameter after the trade was initially reported.
     *     - `restated`: Sent when the order is manually modified.

     *     These values cannot be modified by the Broker Partners.
     *
     *
     *     For the **events** interface we are only broadcasting changes to admin configurations. In case nothing changed for a flag that will not be included in unrelated update events.
     *
     *     Depending on the type of the Admin Configurations the sent event will behave differently. For bool flags we are only sending the new value.
     *
     *     For example the following payload means, that the disable_shorting flag was set to true from false:
     *
     *     ```
     *     {
     *       "disable_shorting": false
     *     }
     *     ```
     *
     *     For other data types, we are embeding the old and new values into the payload. For example changing the max_margin_multiplier from 4 to 1 will yield this payload:
     *
     *     ```
     *     {
     *       "max_margin_multiplier": {
     *         "old": 4,
     *         "new": 1,
     *       }
     *     }
     *     ```
     *
     *     Introducing an override value from the default will yield a null value as old. For example restricting the max_margin_multipler to 1 from default will yield the following payload:
     *
     *     ```
     *     {
     *       "max_margin_multiplier": {
     *         "old": null,
     *         "new": 1,
